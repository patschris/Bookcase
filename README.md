# Bookcase
Bookcase simulation (written in C++)
Bookcase contains a base, three shelves and a closet that contains two shelves
In every action, we try to place a book somewhere in the bookcase or take a book
Needs two arguments:
  -K : number of random actions (place a book or take a book)
  -L : maximum capacity of the bookcase
