# Bookcase
Bookcase simulation (written in C++). Bookcase contains a base, three shelves and a closet that contains two shelves. In every action, we try to place a book somewhere in the bookcase or take a book. The program needs exactly two integers as arguments: K, the number of random actions (place a book or take a book) and L, the maximum capacity of the bookcase. Contains makefile: make to compile, make clean to delete object files and executable.
