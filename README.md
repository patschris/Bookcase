# Bookcase
Bookcase contains a base, three shelves and a closet that contains two shelves. In every action, we try to place a book somewhere in the bookcase or take a book. The program needs exactly two integers as arguments, *K*: the number of random actions (place a book or take a book) and *L*: the maximum capacity of the bookcase. Contains makefile: `make` to compile and `make clean` to delete the object files and the executable. Written in C++, Ubuntu 16.04.3 LTS.
